# Statistical Learning and Data Mining: Predicting myocardial infarction (MI) complications and death using tree-based methods

This was a collaborative project for a statistical learning and data mining course for Masters of Science graduate students.  My primary contribution entailed the comparison of four classification methods (single decision tree, pruned tree, random forest, and boosting), evaluated model performance using misclassification rates and AUC, and conducted sensitivity analysis for handling missing data.

#### Abstract
Accurately predicting complications and death following myocardial infarction (MI) is crucial for improving patient outcomes. This study aims to identify important predictors and compare the performance of different tree-based machine learning models for predicting MI complications and death using data from 1,700 patients admitted to the hospital for MI in Siberia, Russia. Four classification methods were applied: single decision tree, pruned tree, random forest, and boosting (AdaBoost). The models were trained on 70% of the data and tested on the remaining 30%. Model performance was evaluated using misclassification error rates and area under the ROC curve (AUC).  A sensitivity analysis explored different approaches for handling missing data in decision tree packages and randomforest. Key predictors of MI complication and death identified included age, chronic heart failure, use of nitrates, angina pectoris, lateral MI, and white blood cell count. Random forest demonstrated the best performance, with the lowest cross-validated misclassification error (33.1% for complications, 7.4% for death) and highest AUC (0.748 for complications, 0.842 for death). Overall, this study highlights the potential of tree-based machine learning models, particularly random forest, for predicting adverse outcomes in MI patients and identifies important risk factors to guide clinical decision-making.
